# MOVIE TRACKER API

## LINK TO THE API :

https://movieapimp.herokuapp.com/movies

## TECHNOLOGIES USED :

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* Postgresql
* Postman
* Heroku


## PROJECT SUMMARY :

Created an api that allows a user to save movies they would like to watch. It's a full CRUD api, so a user can update, delete and create a new movie.

## APPROACH TAKEN :

Created the api in rails, since only the data of the API was presented and there was no user functionality, the api was tested on Postman. Postman gave us the oppurtunity to test all CRUD functionality.

## DIFFICULTIES

- Not knowing I can name my table and a column the same name.
